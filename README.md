# Finance-modeling

In this section, I would like to share my analysis of real-world financial data in a variety of settings. My main goal is to analyze financial 
data using Python. Topics include analysis of properties of historical equity returns, portfolio optimization, Monte Carlo simulation, and textual analysis. 

I will be downloading,  preparing,  and  analyzing  large  data  sets  from  public  sources  including  Yahoo! Finance, the Fama-French data library, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s FRED database, and the SEC’s EDGAR database. 



# first topic is to get to know how to use python
